    <p>My name is Kimaren Naidoo, a software engineer with a passion for building efficient, scalable, and secure applications. I’m always exploring new technologies, whether it's in <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/devops/what-is-devops/">DevOps</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cisco.com/site/us/en/learn/topics/security/what-is-cybersecurity.html">Cybersecurity</a>, or <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network">Networking</a>.</p>
    <p>I have a <strong>bachelor's degree</strong> in Computer science and IT. I have an unwavering passion for learning. My journey in tech is fueled by curiosity and a constant desire to improve. I aspire to be a senior software engineer with deep expertise in DevOps and cloud computing. I am passionate about solving complex problems through technology and continuous learning.</p>
    <p>Beyond my technical pursuits, I have a deep appreciation for philosophy, particularly <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism">Stoicism</a>. I believe in discipline, resilience, and the power of focused effort—values that shape both my work and personal life. I enjoy running long distances, improving my chess skills, studying philosophy, and diving into the complexities of physics, mathematics, and astrophysics. I’m also fascinated by cars, engines, and mechanical systems, always eager to learn how things work under the hood.</p>
    <p>When I’m not writing code or studying a new topic, you’ll find me reading, watching <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship">UFC</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One">F1</a>, sketching, working out, or training for my next run. Above all, I strive to be a lifelong learner, a disciplined individual, and an intentional and supportive presence in the lives of those around me.</p>
