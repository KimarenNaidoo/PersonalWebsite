<div class="content">
    <p>My name is Kimaren Naidoo, a software engineer with a passion for building efficient, scalable, and secure applications. I’m always exploring new technologies, whether it's in <a target="_blank" href="#">DevOps</a>, <a target="_blank" href="#">Cybersecurity</a>, or <a target="_blank" href="#">Networking</a>.</p>
    <p>I have a bachelor's in Computer science and IT. I am always passionate about learning new things. My journey in tech is fueled by curiosity and a constant desire to improve.</p>
    <p>Beyond my technical pursuits, I have a deep appreciation for philosophy, particularly Stoicism. I believe in discipline, resilience, and the power of focused effort—values that shape both my work and personal life. I enjoy running long distances, improving my chess skills, studying philosphy, and diving into the complexities of physics, mathematics, and astrophysics. I’m also fascinated by cars, engines, and mechanical systems, always eager to learn how things work under the hood.</p>
    <p>When I’m not writing code or studying a new topic, you’ll find me reading, watching UFC or F1, sketching, working out, or training for my next run. Above all, I strive to be a lifelong learner, a disciplined individual, and an intentional being and supportive presence for those around me.</p>
